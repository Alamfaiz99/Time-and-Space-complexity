Asymptotic Analysis:
-->The idea is to measure the order of growth.
-->Doesnot depend upon machine,programming language used
-->No need to implement we can analyse

Order of growth-->Is then time taken to solve the function


Best,worst and average case of an algorithm
-->We divide the order of growth of an algoritm into best worst and average cases

int getSum(int[] arr,int n){
    int sum=0;//const statement(c2)
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        sum+=arr[i];//n times const statement-->c1*n
    }
    return sum;(c2)
}

Time complexity:c1*n+c2-->O(n)-->Ignore the lower order term and accept the higher order term only

int getSum(int[] arr,int n){
    if(n%2==0){
        return 0;
    }
    int sum=0;//const statement(c2)
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        sum+=arr[i];//n times const statement-->c1*n
    }
    return sum;(c2)
}

Best case:constant-->when n is even-->Bogus-->rarely we consider
Average case-->We take equally likely probablity of both the cases-->we consider sometimes
Worst case-->Linear-->most of the time we find

-->When we are building a software w emostly consider the worst case
-->best case will not tell every thing about the software
